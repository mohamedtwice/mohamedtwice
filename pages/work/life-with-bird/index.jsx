        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>Life with Bird gave us with the challenge of rebuilding their Shopify theme. Part of it&apos;s remit was to improve the user experience and include a much cleaner UI that matched their brand and achieved   more conversions. The current code and deployment solution also needed revisiting to be scalable and flexible.</p>

        <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>Whilst working at <OutboundLink to="http://inlight.com.au">Inlight</OutboundLink>, myself and 1 other developer worked together closely with the client to provide a solution they sought after. After looking at the current codebase, we realised that we needed to rebuild the existing solution. I was responsible for the majority of the delivery.</p>
